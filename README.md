# python-challenge
Module 3 Python project

This Module 3 Assignment is in two parts
The first part represents files contained in the folder PyBank. Within the PyBank folder are two folders: analysis, Resources, and 1 file: main.py
The main.py file is the primary script file which analyses the document: budget_data.csv. This latter document is located in the Resources folder which is in turn located in the PyBank main folder. The main.py script file also when run, produces the summary file: analysis_budget_data.txt. This latter file is located within the analysis folder. That folder resides in the main PyBank folder. 

The second part represents files contained in the folder PyPoll. Within the PyPoll folder are two folders: analysis, Resources, and 1 file: main.py
The main.py file is the primary script file which analyses the document: election_data.csv. This latter document is located in the Resources folder which is in turn located in the PyBank main folder. The main.py script file also when run, produces the summary file: election_analysis_data.txt. This latter file is located within the analysis folder. That folder resides in the main PyPoll folder.

Both the PyBank and PyPoll folders are the main folders that constitute the repository: python-challenge. 

The Python code presented in both main.py files are adaptations of materials presented in class. I added additional lines of code within both main.py files to format the numbers (using a comma to separate thousands) in the analysis_budget_data.txt and election_analysis_data.txt files to make them more readable.
